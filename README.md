DS 210 Final Project - Samyuktaa Jayakrishnan

The Enron scandal was a series of events involving illegal accounting practices that resulted in the bankruptcy of the company. By using accounting tactics to hide their debt and inflate their profits, Enron led their company to bankruptcy. I chose to analyze a dataset of Enronâ€™s email communication network that was uncovered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation of this scandal. There are 36,692 nodes and 18,3831 edges, and if an address i sent at least one email to address j, the graph contains an undirected edge from i to j. The main goal of this project is to see if there are any significant connections between nodes that should have been flagged during the investigation, or if there are any specific emails nodes that are highly communicative. I do this by measuring BFS and closeness centrality.
